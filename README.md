<p>This is a web autentication application that allows you register guests for an event and return them a unique identification code,which would serve as their gate pass for your event.</p>
<p>It has a registration page which collects email and other information about the guest and stores in a database.
Each user will have a unique QR code returned to them and sent to their mail when registration is complete.
This QR code could be scanned to reveal the user's identity at the gate and once scanned, noted in the database that the user attended the event.</p>
<p>It was built using HTNML/CSS and javascript for the frontend, python and django framework for the server and postgres SQL for the database.</p>
